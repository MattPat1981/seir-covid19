# the Stan code

This directory contains the Stan code for the SEIR model. Currently there are two different model versions:
 * `seir_v8.stan`: Original version without time-dependence in the prior for the fraction of infectious tested.
 * `seir_v9.stan`: Updated version where time-dependence in the prior for the fraction of infectious tested can be prescribed.
