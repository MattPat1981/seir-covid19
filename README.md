# The Santa Cruz County COVID-19 model

The Santa Cruz County (SCZ) COVID-19 model is a time-discrete, stochastic SEIR model that uses Bayesian statistical methods, such as Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations, to forecast the COVID-19 pandemic in Santa Cruz County, California. The model requires a set of parameters, equations, and local data to help inform its simulations. The model is set to run 4,000 simulations and fine-tune the inputted parameters using the local data (confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations, confirmed COVID-19 cases, and deaths). The model projects a range of different scenarios that fit the inputs provided and are displayed in the exported plots.

The model contains 9 compartments to divide COVID-19 cases into the asymptomatic, mild, and moderate to severe illness, which better informs hospitalization and death projections (see diagram below).

The Jupyter notebook using data from Santa Cruz County can be found [here](seir_santa_cruz.ipynb), a template notebook can be found [here](seir_template.ipynb).

**Note:** If you have issues, questions or find a bug please create an issue in GitHub (above).

## Additional Assumptions of the SCZ COVID-19 Model
- The model's contact rate adjusts every 5 days using spline interpolation.
- COVID-19 cases who recover gain short-term immunity.
- COVID-19 cases can be infectious 2 to 3 days prior to symptom onset.
- COVID-19 hospitalization, ICU, and death rates are calculated based on the overall age demographics of Santa Cruz County.
- Not everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 goes to the hospital.
- COVID-19 cases only die within the hospital.
- Hospitalized COVID-19 patients have a shorter duration of their infectious period because they are less likely to expose others. However, they likely will shed live virus longer, especially if immuno-compromised.
- The model does not account for spatial or network patterns.

## Model updates

### 2020-08-09:
 - Added temporary disclaimer to the plots stating that due to a problem with the State of Californiaâ€™s CalREDIE reporting system, cases have been underreported and projected results likely represent underestimates.
 - This problem is affecting the data being fed into the recent projections, not the model code.

### 2020-07-21:
 - Priors for model misfit parameters (`lambda_Iobs`, `lambda_Hmod`, `lambda_Hicu`, `lambda_Rmort`) can now be set by the user.
 - Santa Cruz and default parametrization now use a tighter fit to mortality data and a looser fit to case count.
 - Mean of the prior for rate of mortality has been changed from 1% to 0.5% based on observed mortality in Santa Cruz County.  

## Instruction for running the model

The core of the model is written in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) and a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is used for reading in data, running the model and visualizing its output. Installation instructions are provided [here](installation_instructions.md). 

In order to provide a new dataset or change the model parameters, edit the begining of the notebook where each input parameter and the required data files are described in detail.

<a name="betafootnote">[1]</a> A time-dependent contact rate is then estimated from the data using an AR(1) process and spline interpolation. 

<a name="fractionfootnote">[2]</a> Currently increased over time using key dates, see [notebook](seir_santa_cruz.ipynb) for details. 

<a name="dirichletfootnote">[3]</a> All 5 fractions are drawn from the same Dirichlet distribution.
